        <p>
          My name is Soheil. I'm a Full Stack Engineer from Germany's most delightful city, Hamburg.
          <br />
          <br />
          I enjoy reading books. Some of my favourites are Harari's
          <mark>Sapiens</mark> and <mark>Homo Deus</mark> and Goethe's <mark>Faust</mark>. I also like running. I'm
          currently interested in robust, expandable and simple software architecture design in web applications. And
          frontend tooling.
